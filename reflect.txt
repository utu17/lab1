\f0\fs24 \cf0 I found that Python is a versatile and expressive programming language as it emphasizes very clean and readable code, which makes it easier to understand and python has very straightforward syntax.\
I have seen that python is an interpreted language, which generally makes it slower than compiled languages like C/C++. Also, Python allows dynamic typing, but it lacks built-in support for static typing, unlike languages like C/C++\
Based on syntax Python has a more concise and readable syntax compared to C/C++. \
Performance wise C/C++ generally outperforms Python due to its low-level nature and direct hardware access.}
